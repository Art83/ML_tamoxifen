Supervised machine learning using support vector machine (SVM) determined predictors of progression from the early ischemic state to the dementia-like state. It showed that caspase-3 and ERÎ± in the CA1 and exploration proportion were reliable and accurate predictors of this progression. Importantly, tamoxifen ameliorated SI-induced effects on all three of these variables, providing further evidence for its viability as a candidate treatment for SI and prevention of associated dementia.
